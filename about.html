        <h2>TE Certification Program</h2>

To be a TE Certified Technician you must have over 5 years of residential experience, be drug-free and fingerprinted by the GA State law, and pass written and hands-on tests at the TE Lab of Electrical Excellence. We set the bar high for service, attend weekly and annual training, and maintain a clean driving record. In addition, TE Certified Technicians dress in professional uniforms, wear shoe covers, post signs, and cleanup. In short, they are the type of professionals you would want in your home.</p>
